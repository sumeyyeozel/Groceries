# Groceries

## Details of the dataset
The dataset has 38765 rows of the purchase orders of people from the grocery stores. These orders can be analysed and association rules can be generated using Market Basket Analysis by algorithms like Apriori Algorithm.

## Associating Rule
Learning of Association rules is used to find relationships between attributes in large databases. An association rule, A=> B, will be of the form” for a set of transactions, some value of itemset A determines the values of itemset B under the condition in which minimum support and confidence are met”.

* Support: This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears.

* Confidence: This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears.

* Lift: This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased while controlling for how popular item Y is.
