## Associating Rule
Learning of Association rules is used to find relationships between attributes in large databases. An association rule, A=> B, will be of the form” for a set of transactions, some value of itemset A determines the values of itemset B under the condition in which minimum support and confidence are met”.

* Support: This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears.

* Confidence: This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears.

* Lift: This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased while controlling for how popular item Y is.
